Stratos provides a mechanism for customizing the theme, including:

- Changing the theme colors
- Changing image assets (favorite icon, login background and logo)
- Overriding styles
- Changing the initial loading indicator

The easiest way to create a theme is to create a folder in the `src/frontend/packages` folder.
